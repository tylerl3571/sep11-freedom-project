## Context:
* I decided to use Kaboom.js to make a platformer game
* It lets me make something of my interest.

## Product:
* I will use Kaboom.js because it seemed to let me make something that I was interested in. I am going to make a platformer game that is a Mr.Mueller look-a-like that jumps up like Mario and collects rubber duckies. I could also add sprites that look like low grades and make it so that when the Mr.Mueller sprite lands on the low grade sprite, it would destroy it.

## Resources:
* https://kaboomjs.com/

## Global:
* Government/laws: N/A
* Big systems (i.e. education): going to teach people how to have good grades <!-- idk about this -->
* Environment: legal and can be fun for kids
## Social:
* Individual: they would probably have fun
* Relationships: mends relationships
* Culture: people would have fun
## Economic:
* Jobs: shows people the game and then they could make their own game
* Finance (personal/corporate): N/A


## Engineering Design Process:
1) The problem was that I needed to find a way for kids young and old to have fun.
2) I researched this problem by researching about the topic.

## Skills:
* I used certain skills to help me with my Freedom Project. I used researching to research about the topic and how to code everything. I had a bit of trouble making the sprite in the beginning, but I got the hang of it after a day. I also used the skill of organizing by organizing my resources and notes.
