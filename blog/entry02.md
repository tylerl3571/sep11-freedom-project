## Context:
* I decided to use Kaboom.js to make a platformer game
* It lets me make something of my interest.

## Product:
* I will use Kaboom.js because it seemed to let me make something that I was interested in. I am going to make a platformer game that is a Mr.Mueller look-a-like that jumps up like Mario and collects rubber duckies. I could also add sprites that look like low grades and make it so that when the Mr.Mueller sprite lands on the low grade sprite, it would destroy it.

## Resources:
* https://kaboomjs.com/

## Learning along the way:
* This week, I learned how to make levels in Kaboom. I used the code:

```js
const Level([
    "                          $",
    "                          $",
    "           $$         =   $",
    "  %      ====         =   $",
    "                      =    ",
    "       ^^      = >    =   &",
    "===========================",
], {
    "                          $",
    "                 $        $",
    "           $$    $    =   $",
    "  %      ====    $    =   $",
    "    $            $    =    ",
    "   ^ ^^^^      = >    =   &",
    "===========================",
```

the percent sign shows where you spawn in, the up arrow shows the spikes that destroys your sprite, the equal signs show the blocks you can step on, the money signs are the coins, and the "and" sign shows where you go to end it. I tried it beforehand with different code, but it didn't work. I asked my friend Daniel for help and he gave me the starting code:

```js
const levels
```
I also learned how to add the jump force for a sprite using

```js
const JUMP_FORCE = 1320
```
What I learned from the code was:
```js
const
```
is the constant that sets a sprite with something.

```js
JUMP_FORCE
```
represents the jump force of it. Together, the code would set the jump force to be 1320.
## Engineering Design Process:
1) The problem was that I needed to find a way for kids young and old to have fun.
2) I researched this problem by researching about the topic.

## Skills:
* I used certain skills to help me with my Freedom Project. I used researching to research about the topic and how to code everything. I had a bit of trouble making the sprite in the beginning, but I got the hang of it after a day. I also used the skill of organizing by organizing my resources and notes.

## Goals:
* My goal for the winter break is to finish up writing my code so that it works and I can see it load instead of a white screen appearing.
