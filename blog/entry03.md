## Context:
* I decided to use Kaboom.js to make a platformer game
* It lets me make something of my interest.

## Product:
* I will use Kaboom.js because it seemed to let me make something that I was interested in. I am going to make a platformer game that is a Mr.Mueller look-a-like that jumps up like Mario and collects rubber duckies. I could also add sprites that look like low grades and make it so that when the Mr.Mueller sprite lands on the low grade sprite, it would destroy it.

## Resources:
* https://kaboomjs.com/

## Learning along the way:
* This week, I was struggling to find out why my code wasn't working and learning new code.
* I struggled in trying to find out why it only showed a white screen when I inserted the code:

```js
http-server
```

I asked friends on how to fix it to no avail, so I would have to ask Mr.Mueller for why it isn't working next Monday.
I learned how to add the jump force for a sprite using

```js
const JUMP_FORCE = 1320
```
What I learned from the code was:
```js
const
```
is the constant that sets a sprite with something.

```js
JUMP_FORCE
```
represents the jump force of it. Together, the code would set the jump force to be 1320.
## Engineering Design Process:
1) The problem was that I needed to find a way for kids young and old to have fun.
2) I researched this problem by researching about the topic.

## Skills:
* I used certain skills to help me with my Freedom Project. I used researching to research about the topic and how to code everything. I had a bit of trouble making the sprite in the beginning, but I got the hang of it after a day. I also used the skill of organizing by organizing my resources and notes.

## Goals:
* Ask Mr.Mueller on how to fix my code
