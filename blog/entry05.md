## Context:
* I decided to use Kaboom.js to make a platformer game
* It lets me make something of my interest.

## Product:
* I will use Kaboom.js because it seemed to let me make something that I was interested in. I am going to make a platformer game that is a bean that jumps up like Mario and collects coins. I could also add sprites that look like spikes and make it so that when the bean sprite lands on the spike sprite, it would destroy the bean.

## Resources:
* https://kaboomjs.com/

## Learning along the way:
* This week, I was struggling to find out why my code wasn't working and learning new code.
* I struggled in trying to find out why it still wasn't working when I inserted the code:

```js
http-server
```

I asked friends on how to fix it to no avail, so I went to Wednesday Tutoring and learned from other seniors about why my code was wrong. I fixed my code by restarting the code again. Although everything seemed perfect from my game, I switched my up key from "space" to the "up" key. This caused my code to stop working whenever the sprite hit the coin. I asked them what was wrong, but even they couldn't figure it out, so I have to find out what's wrong with it. I learned how to make a level using:

```js
const LEVELS = [
	[
		"@  ^ $$ >",
		"==========",
	],
	[
		"@   $   >",
		"=   =   =",
	],
]
```
What I learned from the code was:
```js
const LEVELS
```
This makes a constant of LEVELS to help show the level.

```js
[
		"@  ^ $$ >",
		"==========",
	]
```
is the code to make the level. An equal sign is the block used, the @ sign is used as the starting point, the ^ means a spike, money is used as the coins, and > means the portal sign to teleport to the next level.
## Engineering Design Process:
1) The problem was that I needed to find a way for kids young and old to have fun.
2) I researched this problem by researching about the topic and making sure it's fun.

## Skills:
* I used certain skills to help me with my Freedom Project. I used researching to research about the topic and how to code everything. I had a bit of trouble making sure the code worked, but I think I got the hang of it after a while. I also used the skill of organizing by organizing my resources and notes.

## Goals:
* make new levels and complete coding
